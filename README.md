# Installation

Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g math-slide # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon
```

And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev math-slide # or using yarn: yarn add nodemon -D
```

With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path or you can't use it directly from the command line. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.

# Usage

nodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:

```bash
nodemon [your node app]
```

For CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:

```bash
nodemon -h
```

Using nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:

```bash
nodemon ./server.js localhost 8080
```

Any output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.

You can also pass the `inspect` flag to node through the command line as you would normally:

```bash
nodemon --inspect ./server.js 80
```

If you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).

nodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).

Also check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) or [issues](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues) for nodemon.

  script: ...,
  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console
}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up
  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));
  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));
});
```
